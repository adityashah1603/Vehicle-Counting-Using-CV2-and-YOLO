Vehicle Counting Using CV2 and YOLO


Welcome to the Vehicle Counting Using CV2 and YOLO repository! 🚗🔍

This project combines the power of computer vision and state-of-the-art object detection through YOLO to accurately count vehicles in a given video feed. Whether you're interested in traffic analysis, parking management, or simply exploring the capabilities of computer vision, this repository provides a robust foundation.

🛠️ Features:
CV2 Integration: Harnessing the capabilities of OpenCV (CV2), this project utilizes computer vision techniques to process video streams and extract valuable information about vehicular movement.

YOLO Object Detection: The YOLO algorithm is employed to identify and track vehicles in real-time. Its efficiency allows for accurate and rapid detection, making it an ideal choice for this application.

Vehicle Counting: The core functionality revolves around accurately counting vehicles, providing valuable insights for traffic monitoring, urban planning, and more.
